# Challenge.1
This will be Challenge 1, For Module 1:Financial Programming with Python

I would like to Inform who Reviews My Challenge, that i created an additional file which is loan_analyzer.ipynb 
This File is inside this Repository and Contains the Same Code From loan_analyzer.py(also inside this repository), 
The Difference would be the Comments/Instructions. Since it is visually Better to Read/Review code and Run/Debug, 

My last commit Includes an Update to the File loan_analyzer.ipynb with Comments to Explain the Functionality of the Code. 
The Second to last Commit Does not include the Comments. If Perferred to review for better visability of code.
