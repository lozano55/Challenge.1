# Challenge.1
This will be Challenge 1, For Module 1:Financial Programming with Python

I would like to Inform who Reviews My Challenge, that i created an additional file which is loan_analyzer.ipynb 
This File Contains the Same Code From loan_analyzer.py, but without the Comments/Instructions that is vissually
Better to Read/Review code and Run/Debug, 

My last commit Includes an Update to the File loan_analyzer.ipynb with Comments to Explain the Functionality of the Code. 
The Second to last Commit Does not include the Comments. If Perferred to review for better visability of code.
